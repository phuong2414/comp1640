                <p>On our website, we assert that everyone has a right to privacy. We aim to provide our consumers the tools
                    they need to take control of their identity. Our website, Inc. ("our website," "we," or "us") collects, uses,
                    and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online
                    products and services (collectively, the "Services"), when you interact with us in any other way, or
                    when you receive
                    communications from us. We explain how and why we do this in this privacy statement.
                </p>
                
                <p>We only gather the bare minimum of data that can automatically be used to locate you. You don't need
                    to create an account if you just want to browse. We don't need you to tell us your actual name if
                    you wish to register for an account to use one of our websites. Your exact location is not
                    automatically tracked by us. You are free to provide as much or as little personal information
                    as you choose. You have the option to set up additional accounts, edit information as necessary,
                    or request that we erase your information.
                </p>
                
                <p>Any information we gather is largely used to deliver our services, which encourage social interaction and
                    the formation of communities, the great majority of which are open to the general public.
                    You may always ask us for further information if you have any queries about how we utilize your data.</p>

                    that account will have a username that you supply or that was produced automatically.
                    Your username is visible to the public and need not be connected to your legal name. Depending on whether
                    you register using an email address or a Single Sign-On (SSO) function, you might be required to give a
                    password (such as Apple or Google).</p>
                
                <p>You might choose to submit additional, optional information when using our website. We could ask you to pick
                    groups (like r/technology) to join or hobbies (like history, nature, or sports) to help us develop a feed just
                    for you. In addition, you may provide other details like your bio, gender, age, location, or profile image.
                    This data is optional and is always subject to removal. Your user account choices and information are also
                    stored by us. To enhance your experience while browsing our website, we could ask for these information
                    before you create a username or account.</p>
