                    we will make every effort to warn you in advance, but this may not always be feasible. We retain the right, with or
                    without notice to you, to alter, suspend, or cancel the Services (in whole or in part). Each subsequent release, upgrade,
                    or other enhancement to the Services' functionality shall be subject to these Terms, which may be modified from time to time.
                    You agree that we will not be responsible to you or any other person if the Services or any portion of them are modified,
                    suspended, or discontinued.</p>
                <h3>4. You're Our Account and Account Security</h3>
                <p>To access certain aspects of our Services, you may be required to create an Our account (an "Account") and
                    give us with a username, password, and other personal information as specified in the Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>You are entirely responsible for the information linked with your Account and everything that occurs in connection
                    with it. You must keep your Account secure and tell us immediately if you find or think that someone has accessed
                    your Account without your consent. We recommend that you create a strong password for your Account and enable
                    two-factor authentication.</p>
                <p>Without our previous written consent, you will not license, sell, or transfer your Account.</p>
                <h3>5. Your Content</h3>
                <p>The Services may contain information, text, links, pictures, photographs, videos, music, streaming, or other
                    materials ("Content"), including Content authored by you or contributed through your Account ("Your Content").
                    We accept no responsibility for Your Content and do not directly or implicitly promote, support, or guarantee its
                    completeness, honesty, accuracy, or reliability.</p>
                <p>By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all of the rights, power,
                    and authority required to grant the rights to Your Content set out in these Terms. Because you are solely
                    responsible for Your Content, posting or sharing it without all essential rights may subject you to responsibility.</p>
                <p>You retain all ownership rights in Your Content, but you grant Us the following permission to use it:</p>
                <p>When you create or submit Your Content to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual,
                    irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sub licensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt,
                    prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username,
                    voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known
                    or later developed. This license grants us the right to make Your Content accessible for syndication,
                    broadcast, distribution, or publishing by other companies, organizations, or people with whom collaborate.
                    You also agree that we may delete metadata linked with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any moral
                    rights or attribution claims you may have with respect to Your Content.</p>
                <p>Any ideas, thoughts, or feedback you offer to us concerning Our or our Services are totally optional,
                    and you agree that Our may utilize such ideas, suggestions, or feedback without compensation or obligation to you.</p>
                <p>Although we have no responsibility to filter, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may delete or remove it at any
                    time and for any reason, including if you violate these Terms, our Content Policy, or if you otherwise cause
                    or are likely to create liability for us.</p>
                <h3>6. Third-Party Content, Advertisements, and Promotions</h3>
                <p>The Services may include links to third-party websites, products, or services offered by advertisers, affiliates,
                    partners, or other users ("Third-Party Content"). We have no control over third-party content and are not responsible
                    for any third-party websites, goods, or services. You use Third-Party Content at your own risk,
                    and you should do all required research before proceeding with any transaction involving such Third-Party Content.</p>
                <p>There may also be sponsored Third-Party Content or advertising on the Services. You understand and agree that
                    we may post advertising in connection with the display of any Content or information on the Services,
                    including Your Content, and that the kind, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change.</p>
                <p>If you choose to use the Services to run a promotion, such as a contest or sweepstakes ("Promotion"),
                    you are solely responsible for carrying out the Promotion in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,
                    including but not limited to developing official rules, offer terms, eligibility requirements, and adhering to
                    all applicable laws, rules, and regulations that govern the Promotion (such as licenses, registrations, bonds,
                    and regulatory approval). Your Promotion must specify that it is not sponsored, promoted, or linked with Us,
                    and the rules for your Promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Us from any and all
                    responsibility arising from the Promotion. You understand and accept that we will not assist you with your
                    promotion in any manner, and you agree to conduct your Promotion at your own risk.</p>
                <h3>7. Moderators</h3>
                <p>Users of the Services may be able to apply for an unofficial, voluntary role moderating a sub.
                    We are not responsible for the moderators' activities. We reserve the right to withdraw or limit a user's
                    capacity to moderate at any time and for any reason, including a violation of these Rules.</p>
                <p>• If you choose to moderate a sub, you agree to follow the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities; </p>
                <p>• You agree that when you receive reports related to a sub you moderate, you will take appropriate action,
                    which may include removing content that violates policy and/or promptly escalating to Our for review;</p>
                <p>You are not, and may not represent that you are, authorized to act on Our's behalf; </p>
                <p>• You really aren't, and may not represent that you are, authorized to act on Our's behalf;</p>
                <p>• You may not engage into any arrangement with a third party on Our behalf, or on behalf of any subs
                    that you moderate, without our express consent; </p>
                <p>• You may not undertake moderating activities in exchange for any kind of remuneration, reward, gift,
                    or favor from third parties;</p>
                <p>• You may design and enforce rules for the subs you moderate, providing such rules do not contradict
                    with these Terms, the Content Policy, or the Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities.</p>
                <p>Our maintains the right, but assumes no responsibility, to reverse any moderator's action or
                    decision if Our, in its sole discretion, feels that such action or decision is not in the best interests
                    of Our or the Our community.</p>
                <h3>8. Changes to these Terms</h3>
                <p>From time to time, we could modify these Terms. If we do, we'll release the updated Terms and
                    adjust the aforementioned Effective Date. If you have elected to submit an email address connected with
                    your Account, we may additionally inform you by sending an email to that address, or by another means through
                    our Services, if the changes, in our sole opinion, are substantial. You agree to be bound by the amended Terms
                    if you use or use the Services on or after the revised Terms' Effective Date. Before the changes take effect,
                    you must discontinue using our Services if you do not agree to the updated Terms.</p>

                <h3>9. Termination</h3>

                <p>By deleting your Account and ceasing to use the Services, you may end these Terms at any time and for any reason.
                    Your Account may be deleted if you cease using the Services without canceling it due to an extended period
                    of inactivity.</p>

                <p>We may suspend or terminate your Account, moderator position, or your ability to access or use the Services
                    at any time for any or no reason, including for violating these Terms or our Content Policy,
                    to the maximum extent authorized by applicable law.</p>

                <h3>10. Miscellaneous</h3>

                <p>The Privacy Policy and any other agreements that are expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms,
                    along with these Terms, make up the complete agreement between you and us governing your use of the Services
                    and access to them. Any right or term of these Terms that we fail to execute or enforce will not be deemed
                    to have been waived by us. If any portion of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable,
                    the remaining portions will continue to be in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable portion
                    will be given effect to the maximum degree practicable. Without our permission, you are not permitted
                    to assign or transfer any of your rights or duties under these Conditions. Any of our rights and
                    responsibilities under these may be freely assigned by us.</p>
